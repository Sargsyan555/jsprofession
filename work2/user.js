/*3. Create a constructor named User and create a way to check the number of users (number of
instances) that were created, so that the value can be accessed as a class attribute.
Example:
u1 = new User("johnsmith10")
User.userCount ➞ 1
u2 = new User("marysue1989")
User.userCount ➞ 2
u3 = new User("milan_rodrick")
User.userCount ➞ 3
